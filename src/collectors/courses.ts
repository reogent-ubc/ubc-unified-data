/** Course Schedule: every course, every scheduled section, and the code lists.
 *
 * Source: the Drupal JSON:API behind courses.students.ubc.ca (UBC's Workday-era
 * Course Schedule site). Sections carry days, start/end times, dates, instructors,
 * credits, delivery mode and status; courses carry credits, subject and course
 * number. Taxonomy files resolve the ids that courses and sections point at.
 *
 * The API serves both campuses from one collection with no campus field, so this
 * collector derives one -- from the `_V`/`_O` course-code suffix, the "(UBC-V)"
 * term label, the "(Vancouver)" subject label, or a standard timetable's campus
 * relationship -- writes it as a `campus` column, and then applies the campus
 * selection. Records with no campus marker are always kept.
