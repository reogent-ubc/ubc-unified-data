/** Academic Calendar: the official course catalogue and academic structure.
 *
 * Source: the Drupal JSON:API behind vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca and
 * okanagan.calendar.ubc.ca. This is the catalogue rather than the schedule -- what
 * a course *is*, not when it runs. Pair it with the `courses` collector for both.
 *
 * Caveat worth knowing: the dedicated `field_course_prerequisite`,
 * `field_course_co_requistite`, `field_course_vector` and
 * `field_course_equivalency` fields exist in the schema but are empty on every
 * record sampled. UBC writes all of that into `field_course_description` as prose,
 * which is also how its own pages render it. `coursetext.parseCourseText` splits
 * it back out into `prerequisite`, `corequisite`, `equivalency`,
 * `credit_exclusion` and `hours_vector` columns; the raw description is kept.
 *
 * The calendar is more than courses, though. Everything else it publishes --
 * degree and specialization requirements, faculty and school overviews, admission
 * rules, academic regulations, the dates-and-deadlines tables -- is a `ubc_page`
 * node with a body of HTML. Those come down here too, and `calendarpages` works
 * out what each one is and where it sits in the hierarchy.
