/** Statutory holidays, which UBC publishes from HR rather than the calendar.
 *
 * There is no API and no feed for these -- hr.ubc.ca renders them as a page, and
 * the page is a year heading, then a month heading, then a two-column table for
 * each month that has one:
 *
 *     <h2>2026 statutory holidays</h2>
 *     <h4>JANUARY</h4>
 *     <table><tr><td>Thursday, January 1</td><td>New Year's Day</td></tr></table>
 *     <h4>MARCH</h4>
 *     <p><em>N/A</em></p>
 *
 * The year comes from the last heading that carried one; month and day come from
 * the date cell itself, which names its month and occasionally its year too. The
 * month headings are only navigation -- a row already says "January 1" -- so they
 * are read past. Months with no holiday have no table, which needs no handling:
 * there is simply nothing to read.
 *
 * Two of these are UBC's own rather than BC's (Easter Monday and Boxing Day, both
 * marked with an asterisk upstream). The asterisk is stripped from the name and
 * recorded as `ubc_specific` instead of being thrown away.
